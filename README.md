# How I set this up

1. Make your Github project
2. Set up node
3. Put the basic prefab neocities stuff in your public folder
4. [Download this workflow](https://deploy-to-neocities.neocities.org/)
5. Place the .yml file in a .github/workflows folder
6. Make sure the .yml is set to deploy from the correct branch

(I'm not 100% sure this is right, this is me attempting to recollect how I went about this some 8 months ago)
